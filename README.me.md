# DnD5Helper
Dungeons &amp; Dragons v5 program to help create characters you can import to characters sheets and for tools to use while playing

##Goal:

To make it easier to play Dungeons & Dragons, especially with newer people. When I started playing, I even had a hard time keeping track of all of my stuff even with the books on a PDF.

##Premise:

I want to make a progam that will allow you to make any character you want pretty quickly and import it directly to a character sheet you can print off or save. I want to also make a version that will allow you to make enemies. In addition, I want to add tools for rolling dice, a spot for notes, ways to track spells that you have available, item storage, and ways to look up information about enemies, items, or rules.

##Extras:

After I get the tools and what not made, I would like to make a basic quest game that you can import a character to. I hope to make it so you can have different level enemies and situations to see how your character does when handling various problems and maybe print out a report with statistics.

I would also like to add more books from D&D. Right now I will be using an API that just has the default books.
